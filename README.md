## Where to download the IDE or compiler </br>
Scala can be downloaded from their website at https://www.scala-lang.org/download/ and </br>
provides excellent documentation.

## How to install the IDE or compiler </br>
Scala uses the Scala IDE that is based on Eclipse. There are also plugins available </br>
on popular IDEs such as IntelliJ and Visual Studio code. The use of these IDEs </br>
requires you to have Java already installed on your machine. The IDE will need to be pointed <br>
to the path of the JDK.

##### If using Mac OS, Scala can be installed by running
```
$ brew update
$ brew install scala
$ brew install sbt
```
*sbt is a build tool commonly used with Scala, as mentioned on Scala's website*

##	How to compile and execute the program </br>
Compilation and execution is done by simply navigating to the folder containing the `main.scala` and `scores.txt` files
and running the command ```scala main.scala```.
